# Table Refactoring Cleanup Summary

## Completed Cleanup Tasks

### 1. Removed Old CSV Export Logic
- ✅ Removed inline CSV generation code from the original ContractsTable component
- ✅ Replaced with `useContractExport` hook that delegates to the service layer
- ✅ Removed manual DOM manipulation for file downloads
- ✅ Removed hardcoded CSV headers and row formatting logic

### 2. Eliminated Unused Imports
- ✅ Removed unused UI components (Badge, DropdownMenu components from main table)
- ✅ Removed unused icons (MoreHorizontal, Eye from main table)
- ✅ Removed formatDate import from main table (moved to ContractsRow)
- ✅ Cleaned up redundant React imports

### 3. Removed Redundant Code
- ✅ Removed duplicate `getStatusVariant` function (moved to ContractsRow)
- ✅ Removed redundant `key` prop from TableRow in ContractsRow
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate table row rendering logic
- ✅ Removed unused state variables

### 4. Fixed Import Paths
- ✅ Updated test files to use correct import paths for ContractDetailsSheet
- ✅ Ensured backward compatibility with re-export from old location
- ✅ Verified all imports are correctly resolved

### 5. Code Organization
- ✅ Moved table-specific logic to dedicated directory structure
- ✅ Separated row rendering logic into dedicated component
- ✅ Maintained clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Ensured proper component hierarchy

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `contracts-table.tsx` (in table directory)
- `contracts-row.tsx`
- `index.ts` (table exports)
- Test files for both components
- Integration tests

### Modified Files
- Original `contracts-table.tsx` (now just re-export)

### Removed Code Patterns
- Inline CSV generation
- Manual file download logic
- Duplicate component logic
- Unused imports and variables
- Redundant state management

## Verification
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No unused imports remain
- ✅ No console warnings or errors
- ✅ Proper error handling maintained
- ✅ Loading states properly handled
- ✅ Backward compatibility preserved

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic separated from business logic
2. **Reusability**: ContractsRow can be reused in other contexts
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more focused components
4. **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
5. **Performance**: Better optimization potential with smaller components
